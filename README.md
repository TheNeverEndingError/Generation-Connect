> **ü§ù Bridging the gap between generations: Connecting senior citizens with local high school students for tasks and tech assistance.**

---

## üí° Overview

**Generations Connect** is a platform designed to create a mutually beneficial relationship within the local community.

**Senior citizens** (Elders) can easily post various tasks‚Äîfrom **yard work** and **errands** to **basic home repairs** and critical **technology assistance**. **High school students** in the area can browse, accept these jobs, and earn money on a flexible schedule.

Our mission is to provide seniors with reliable, local help while offering students valuable work experience, income, and a chance to engage positively with their community.
