> **ü§ù Bridging the gap between generations: Connecting senior citizens with local high school students for tasks and tech assistance.**

---

## üí° Overview

**Generations Connect** is meant to help connect highschoolers and senior citizens in communities. It was built for the Congressinal App Challenge 2025, for Oregon district 4

**Senior citizens** (Elders) can easily post various tasks‚Äîfrom **yard work** and **errands** to **companionship** and **technology assistance**. **High school students** can be hired for these jobs, and earn money on a flexible schedule.

If I made a 2.0, I would add more pictures and images as well as talking with more elders and students to gather more information and data on how I could better the app. I would also try it market it too retirement and assisted living homes to better help my community. I would also make easier account setups for elders and students.

Our mission is to provide seniors with reliable, local help while offering students valuable work experience, income, and a chance to engage positively with their community.
